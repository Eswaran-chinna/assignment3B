          MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets. A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data.
           Each replica-set member may act in the role of primary or secondary replica at any time. All writes and reads
            are done on the primary replica by default. Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary 
            using built-in replication. When a primary replica fails, the replica set automatically conducts an election 
            process to determine which secondary should become the primary. Secondaries can optionally serve read 
            operations, but that data is only eventually consistent by default.

          If the replicated MongoDB deployment only has a single secondary member, a separate daemon called an arbiter 
          must be added to the set. It has a single responsibility, which is to resolve the election of the new primary.
           As a consequence, an idealized distributed MongoDB deployment requires at least three separate servers, 
          even in the case of just one primary and one secondary.
